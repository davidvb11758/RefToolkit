Place a whistle sound file named "whistle.mp3" in this directory.

The whistle sound should be:
- A clear, sharp whistle sound (like a referee whistle)
- Duration: approximately 0.5-1 second
- Format: MP3
- Base frequency around 3000 Hz for proper pitch adjustment

You can:
1. Record your own whistle sound
2. Use a royalty-free whistle sound from sites like:
   - freesound.org
   - zapsplat.com
   - soundbible.com

Make sure the sound file is named exactly: whistle.mp3

Note: The app will handle volume and pitch adjustment programmatically.
If the file is missing, the app will still run but won't produce sound.
